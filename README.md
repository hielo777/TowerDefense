# 🏰 Tower Defense (Construct 3)

> A reimagined Tower Defense prototype built with **Construct 3**, inspired by my previous **Construct 2 YouTube tutorial series**.  
> The main innovation in this version is the use of the **3D Object** feature in Construct 3, along with updated project files and mechanics.  

This repository not only serves as a game prototype but also as a **learning resource**, with partial versions of the project available so that anyone can follow the same step-by-step process demonstrated in the original videos.  

***

## 🎥 Background & Tutorial Context  

A few years ago, I created a **Tower Defense tutorial series for Construct 2** on YouTube.  
This repo continues that journey by:  
- Updating the project to **Construct 3**  
- Rebuilding the mechanics with **modern features**  
- Exploring **3D Object** integration for towers, enemies, and levels  

*(Link to the original YouTube series if you want to reference it here)*  

***

## 🖼️ Overview  

- **Genre:** Tower Defense  
- **Engine:** [Construct 3](https://www.construct.net/)  
- **Core Concept:** Place towers strategically to defeat waves of enemies before they reach the base.  
- **Learning Goal:** Provide a modern reference for learners who want to follow along with the YouTube tutorials while experimenting with new C3 behaviors.  

***

## 🎮 Gameplay Features  

- Build towers on designated spots  
- Towers automatically attack enemies in range  
- Enemies follow paths toward the base  
- Player earns resources to build and upgrade towers  
- Use of **3D Object** for visuals and design variety
